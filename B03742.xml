            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>Humbly ſheweth,</opener>
            <p>THAT where by the Claim of Right. It is provided that all Forfault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Fines, loſs of Offices, Impriſonments, Baniſhments, Perſuits, perſecutions, tortours, and rigorous executions, in the time of the late Reigns be conſidered, and the parties leiſed, redreſſed; True it is, that your Petitioner being guiltie of nothing, ſave <hi>Eccleſiaſtick non conformite;</hi> Yet in <hi>March</hi> 1675, A Gariſon of Souldiers were put in your Petitioners Houſe, and poſſeſſed the ſame, forceing him and his Family to flee from it, when his Wife was bigg with Child, and knew not where to retire; And theſe Souldiers ſeiſed upon the Pleniſhing of your Petitioners houſe, and upon all his Corns in Barn or Barn-yeard, which were in value above Ten Chalders of Victual, which at that time gave a very conſiderable price; So that his dammages at that time ſuſtained in his Pleniſhing, horſe Kine, and Corns, did extend to above ſix Thouſand Merks, and farder with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few weeks thereafrer your petitioner was intercommuned as a fugitive and rebel, in which hardſhip and diſtreſs your Petitioner continued for the ſpace of 14 years, and all that time never returned to his own houſe; But for three years of the 14, was under an Inditement of high Treaſon, and lay Priſoner in the Tolbuith of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for the ſpace of eighteen Moneths, and the laſt ſix years thereof, was confined to the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> Whereby it appears, That your Petitioners Sufferings, Loſs and Perſecutions, have been very great. As alſo, That in all that time, your petitioner could neither proſecute nor defend any Rights pertaining to him, but was expoſed to the running of all preſcriptions, for no Fault nor Negligence could be reckoned on his part.</p>
            <p>May it therefore pleaſe Your Grace and Lordſhips, To take the Premiſſes to your Conſideration, for Reparation of your Petitioners Loſſes, and Sufferings, in ſuch manner as ſhall be thought moſt effectual. And farder to Declare, That in caſe there be any Preſcriptions run againſt your Petitioner, that the ſaids fourteen Years of your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners Diſtreſs may not be reckoned, but diſcounted. In reſpect it is evident, That your Petitioner was utterly <hi>non valens agere,</hi> which in all Law hinders the courſe of Preſcription. <hi>And your Grace and Lordſhips Petitioner ſhall ever pray.</hi>
